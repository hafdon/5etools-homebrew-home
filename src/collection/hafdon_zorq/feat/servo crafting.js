        'You are skilled in the creation of servos—tiny constructs that function as personal assistants. You can cast the find familiar spell as a ritual, creating a servo to serve as your familiar instead of an animal. A servo\'s statistics appear in the "Artifact Creatures" section of this document. In every other way, a servo familiar functions as described in the find familiar spell.',
